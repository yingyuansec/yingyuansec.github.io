I am a Postdoctoral researcher at Sapienza University of Rome, under the supervision of [Prof. Luigi Vincenzo Mancini](https://sites.google.com/di.uniroma1.it/mancini). My research interests include **Adversarial Machine Learning, AI Security, Web Security** and **HCI**, where I primarily focus on using Machine Learning for web security purposes and analysing the security of Machine Learning/AI systems. 


Before that, I was a Postdoctoral researcher at University of Padua (Italy, 2024-2025), where I was working on Privacy-perserving anti-malware. Prior to that, I was a PhD student (in Computer Science) at University of Padua (2020-2024), in the [SPRITZ Security and Privacy Research Group](https://spritz.math.unipd.it/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Mauro Conti](https://www.math.unipd.it/~conti/) and [Prof. Giovanni Apruzzese](https://www.giovanniapruzzese.com/). I was also a visiting scholar at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), supervised by [Prof. Gang Wang](https://gangw.cs.illinois.edu/index.html) (2023); and a visiting scholar at University of Liechtenstein (2023), supervised by Prof. Giovanni Apruzzese. The title of my PhD dissertation is "Machine learning for phishing website detection".

Before moving to Italy, I was a master student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) (China, 2017-2020), where I was honored as the Outstanding Graduate of Beijing and Outstanding Graduate of BUPT. My master thesis focused on data integrity verification.

**Hobby**

I love cooking and exploring flavors from around the world, from Baozi, Hunan and Sichuan cuisine to fresh seafood, basil shrimp spaghetti, chestnut cake, pho, orange chicken, crab cake, and crispy fish and chips... they never fail to make me happy 😆. I also like traveling (or hiking) and have left my footprints in Italy, Iceland, Singapore, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, France, the Netherlands, Croatia, the United States, Monaco, and Czechia... Each journey has brought me beautiful memories! 

Feel free to contact me if you would like to share something with me!
